Data Structure
-----------------------------------
Different ways of organizing data on your computer, that can be used effectively.

Queue - FIFO
Stack - Organizing books

Algorithm
------------------------------------
Set of steps to complete a task

Criteria
1) Correctness
2) Efficiency

Why Companies ask
---------------------------------------
Arranging book in library = Data Structure
Process to find the book = Algorithm

- Checks problem solving skills
- Fundamental concepts of programming in limited time

Types of Data Structure
----------------------------------------
Primitive - Inetger, Float, Character, String, Boolean
Non Primitive
    - Linear
        - Static = Array
        - Dynamic = Linked List, Stack, Queue
    - Non Linear = Tree, Graph

Types of Algorithm
------------------------------------------
- Simple Recursive Algorithm
- Divide and Conquer = Contains two recursion
- Dynamic Programming Algorithm = Based on memoization
- Greedy Algorithm = Choosing local optimal solution
- Brute Force Algorithm = Tries all possibilities until a satisfactory solution is found
- Randomized Algorithm = Uses a random number at least once during the computation to make a decision
